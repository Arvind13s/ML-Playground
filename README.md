# Malaria Detection
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the detection of malaria in blood smear images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Accurate and timely diagnosis of malaria is critical in combating the disease, which affects millions worldwide.This project leverages deep learning techniques to automate the process of identifying infected cells from images, improving efficiency and accuracy in healthcare diagnostics.
Features
->Data Preprocessing: Includes methods for preprocessing blood smear images to enhance CNN performance.
->CNN Architecture: Customizable CNN architecture designed to classify images as malaria positive or negative.
->Model Training & Evaluation: Procedures for training the model on a labeled dataset and evaluating its accuracy with metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
